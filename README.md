# Freecodecamp Certificate Projects

The pandas file contains 5 projects which I wrote on the side to be able to keep notes of the skills required to complete it. 

## Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator:

Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.

## Demographic Data Analyzer:

In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. Here is a sample of what the data looks like:

|    |   age | workclass        |   fnlwgt | education   |   education-num | marital-status     | occupation        | relationship   | race   | sex    |   capital-gain |   capital-loss |   hours-per-week | native-country   | salary   |
|---:|------:|:-----------------|---------:|:------------|----------------:|:-------------------|:------------------|:---------------|:-------|:-------|---------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|:-----------------|:---------|
|  0 |    39 | State-gov        |    77516 | Bachelors   |              13 | Never-married      | Adm-clerical      | Not-in-family  | White  | Male   |           2174 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  1 |    50 | Self-emp-not-inc |    83311 | Bachelors   |              13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial   | Husband        | White  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               13 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  2 |    38 | Private          |   215646 | HS-grad     |               9 | Divorced           | Handlers-cleaners | Not-in-family  | White  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  3 |    53 | Private          |   234721 | 11th        |               7 | Married-civ-spouse | Handlers-cleaners | Husband        | Black  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | <=50K    |
|  4 |    28 | Private          |   338409 | Bachelors   |     

## Medical Data Visualizer:

In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

##  Data description
The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. You will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

## Page View Time Series Visualizer:

For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

## Sea Level Predictor:

You will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
